However there doesn't seem to be an easy way to add files/images to the context window in the CLI. aider has `--file` & `--read` command line options, and fuzzy path finding in-chat to link files (in regular text chats and as `/add` & `/read-only` in-chat commands completion). It would be cool for goose to have similar features.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nHonestly I find the implementation quite good in aider, albeit a bit distracting when it tries to autocomplete each word into a path in-chat. Only triggering to autocompletion with a special tag like `@` would be probably be better. But other than that I don't really see how it could be improved.\n\nI really like that it is possible to link files without necessarily reading them (with: `Add file to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(D)on't ask again [Yes]:`), it is handy for explaining to the LLM how things work without polluting its context window.\n\n**Additional context**\nRelated to  https://github.com/block/goose/issues/1372 / https://github.com/block/goose/issues/1373\n\n- [x] I have verified this does not duplicate an existing feature request\n","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-03-10T15:23:43Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOMneZ988AAAABtyYvwQ","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"number":1591,"state":"OPEN","title":"CLI: Add files/images to chat","url":"https://github.com/block/goose/issues/1591"}
