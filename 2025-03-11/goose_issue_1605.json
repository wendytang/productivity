By default, the buttons do not appear. I open the Goose desktop window to fullscreen on my large monitor and then can see the Add button but not any others.\n\nAfter adding 1-2 environment variables, the height of the modal grows and the buttons are no longer in view. So I can't even click Add.\n\nA workaround is to tab to the buttons and press enter, but I'd have to know the position of them since they are not visible.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Go to '...'\n2. Click on 'Settings'\n3. Scroll down to 'Custom Extension'\n4. Add a few environment variables\n\n**Expected behavior**\nA scrollable modal that allows me to get to the buttons\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4a28f76-827a-4373-9aab-50c2ea9064e4)\n","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-03-10T22:47:27Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOMneZ988AAAAB1nDCPg","name":"ui","description":"","color":"DC6D09"}],"number":1605,"state":"OPEN","title":"Custom Extension Modal Isn't Scrollable","url":"https://github.com/block/goose/issues/1605"}
