I usually want to get other work done during this, but I keep checking back to see if Goose is done working and I can look at the output, or give further instructions to Goose.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nA Settings options to enable desktop notifications when Goose completes tasks.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nFor now, I think just a single setting to notify when Goose is done. But, also could be a notification for each step, and also notifications badges or messaging sounds. Slack has good Notification options to look at for insipration.\n\n- [x] I have verified this does not duplicate an existing feature request\n","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-03-11T20:33:43Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOMneZ988AAAABtyYvwQ","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"number":1625,"state":"OPEN","title":"Notifications","url":"https://github.com/block/goose/issues/1625"}
